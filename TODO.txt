TODO:
-check debugger entering functions
-only allow editing while not running
-Add a console dock to see debug code's text output
-Add a queue widget that has a visual table
	-hovering over a row highlights the corresponding
	    node in the graph
-Look into Qt style support - at least make text less harsh
-Debug highlight is off again?
-Debug seems wonky in general. Takes 2 clicks for a lot of interactions. Maybe a MACOS issue? Try windows. Buttons become dark but don't resolve. Can try to debug by making some print statements.
Seems like it's hanging internally though.


-reset graph at start of execution instead of end (this is a little tricky/messy.)
-Check if queue is getting cleared correctly? Keeps running repeatedly after repeat clicks
-Ending execution also isn't removing the '>' tracker :: update the margin on execution end, needs to be repainted



!!! Can't update labels dynamically. Need Node/Edge to be QObjects which emit signals to their !!!
!!! graphic object counterparts. Good time to separate graph, node, edge from the rest of the. !!!
!!! debugging scripts.                                                                         !!!
