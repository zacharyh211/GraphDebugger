TODO:
-check debugger entering functions
-only allow editing while not running
-Add a console dock to see debug code's text output
-Add a queue widget that has a visual table
	-hovering over a row highlights the corresponding
	    node in the graph
-Look into Qt style support - at least make text less harsh

-reset graph at start of execution instead of end
-Check if queue is getting cleared correctly? Keeps running repeatedly after repeat clicks
-Ending execution also isn't removing the '>' tracker :: update the margin on execution end, needs to be repainted
