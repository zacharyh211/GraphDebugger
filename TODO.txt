TODO:
-Proper reset on import (importlib.reload)
-Make stop and reaching the end of the file actually work
-Have "run" continue on its own until reaching a breakpoint
-Have weighted edges be optional to prevent dialog box from
  showing every time
-Configure the text field to support new/save/open
-Make some template graphs and support for import/export
-Add a console dock to see debug code's text output
-Add a queue widget that has a visual table
	-hovering over a row highlights the corresponding
	    node in the graph
-Look into Qt style support
