TODO:
-check debugger entering functions
-only allow editing while not running

-Debug highlight is off again?

-have the edge preview display an arrowhead when "show-weights" enabled

-reset graph at start of execution instead of end (this is a little tricky/messy.) 
	-Auto breakpoint at end of code to see final graph instead
-Check if queue is getting cleared correctly? Keeps running repeatedly after repeat clicks

-Should eventually change everything to update with signals/slots instead of updating directly.
	The labels broke before. Color changing seems OK as is.
